# Fright-O-Matic

Fright-O-Matic is an application built entirely on Rails designed to generate Halloween pranks in the form of Mad Libs based on the words users select.

Users can choose a category to begin with and from here, will be given 45 seconds to choose words from several drop-down menus that may or may not rank higher than what the computer selects for its Mad Lib. The user plays against the computer each round. 

If a user runs out of time and does not choose words from all dropdowns, the selections will be frozen and the user must choose to select 'Create Madlib.'


## Setup Instructions

  Backend:
 * Download Fright-O-Matic to your local computer selecting the appropriate folder that you wish to test the app in
